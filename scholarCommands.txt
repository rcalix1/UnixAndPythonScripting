The browser issue: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/scholar/faq/jobs/errors/firefoxalreadyrunning

If you ever had a Thinlinc session with Firefox on Scholar overnight, it got killed during nightly reboots, 
so Firefox did not have a chance to clean its defunct lock files. 
Running 

>> unlock-firefox

removes those files and a new instance can start.
